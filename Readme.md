# OWR
## Open Weather Radio

A Weather App providing radio streams from the selected city, made with PyQt5.

### Installation:
[Create and activate a virtual environment,](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) clone, cd, then run

    pip install requirements.txt

### Running:
With the virtual environment activated run

    python qt_ow_app.py

### Enjoy!
This app was created as a practice during the Python Backend Development Course at the [DCI.](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/)

### Known bugs
Sometimes the radio hangs when failing to establish a connection. The App needs to be force-quit then (^C).
